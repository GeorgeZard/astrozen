## Evaluation Criteria

Technologies were evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Compatibility with Current Stack**: How well the technology integrates with our existing Astro + Qwik + TinaCMS architecture
2. **Performance Impact**: Effect on site speed, bundle size, and overall performance
3. **Development Experience**: How the technology affects development workflow and productivity
4. **Unique Value**: What unique capabilities the technology brings to our stack
5. **Maintenance Overhead**: Long-term maintenance considerations and community support

## High Potential Technologies

### Astro DB

**Description**: Official Astro database solution with TypeScript-first ORM and serverless deployment.

**Key Features**:
- SQL database built specifically for Astro
- Local development with automatic schema sync
- TypeScript-first ORM with type safety
- Serverless deployment model

**Compatibility with Current Stack**:
- ✅ Native integration with Astro
- ✅ Works well with serverless functions
- ✅ Complements Git-based CMS for dynamic content
- ✅ Supports our analytics implementation plans

**Implementation Notes**:
```bash
# Installation
npm install @astrojs/db

# Basic configuration in astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import db from '@astrojs/db';

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [db()]
});

# Schema definition in db/config.ts
import { defineDb, defineTable, column } from 'astro:db';

export default defineDb({
  tables: {
    users: defineTable({
      columns: {
        id: column.number({ primaryKey: true }),
        name: column.text(),
        email: column.text({ unique: true }),
      }
    })
  }
});
```

**Potential Use Cases**:
- User accounts and profiles
- Dynamic content beyond Git-based CMS
- Analytics data storage
- Customer journey tracking

### Lucia Auth

**Description**: Lightweight authentication library with Astro integration for session-based authentication.

**Key Features**:
- Framework-agnostic with Astro integration
- Session-based authentication
- Support for various auth methods (username/password, OAuth)
- Database adapter system

**Compatibility with Current Stack**:
- ✅ Works with Astro server endpoints
- ✅ Integrates with Astro DB
- ✅ Lightweight with minimal performance impact
- ✅ Complements our marketing analytics plans

**Implementation Notes**:
```bash
# Installation
npm install lucia @lucia-auth/adapter-prisma
# Or another adapter based on database choice

# Basic setup
// src/lib/lucia.ts
import { lucia } from "lucia";
import { astro } from "lucia/middleware";
import { prisma } from "@lucia-auth/adapter-prisma";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const client = new PrismaClient();

export const auth = lucia({
  adapter: prisma(client),
  env: import.meta.env.DEV ? "DEV" : "PROD",
  middleware: astro()
});

export type Auth = typeof auth;
```

**Potential Use Cases**:
- User authentication for client portals
- Protected content areas
- Personalized marketing experiences
- Admin dashboards for clients

### Preline UI

**Description**: Comprehensive Tailwind CSS component library with 300+ components and UI patterns.

**Key Features**:
- 300+ UI components built on Tailwind CSS
- Enterprise-focused design system
- Responsive and accessible components
- Comprehensive documentation

**Compatibility with Current Stack**:
- ✅ Built directly on TailwindCSS (already in our stack)
- ✅ Works with any framework including Astro
- ✅ No runtime JavaScript requirements
- ✅ Compatible with our component-based architecture

**Implementation Notes**:
```bash
# Installation
npm install preline

# Add to tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // ...
    'node_modules/preline/dist/*.js',
  ],
  plugins: [
    // ...
    require('preline/plugin'),
  ],
}

# Basic usage
<button class="py-3 px-4 inline-flex items-center gap-x-2 text-sm font-semibold rounded-lg border border-transparent bg-blue-600 text-white hover:bg-blue-700 disabled:opacity-50 disabled:pointer-events-none">
  Button
</button>
```

**Potential Use Cases**:
- Accelerated UI development
- Standardized component library
- Client dashboard interfaces
- Marketing website components

## Other Considerations

### HTMX

**Description**: Library that allows HTML attributes to make AJAX requests, enabling dynamic content without JavaScript.

**Key Features**:
- HTML attributes for AJAX, WebSockets, and SSE
- Minimal JavaScript footprint (~14KB)
- Hypermedia-driven approach
- Server-side rendering friendly

**Compatibility Assessment**:
- ⚠️ Different philosophy than Qwik (hypermedia vs resumability)
- ⚠️ Potential overlap in functionality with Qwik
- ✅ Works well with Astro's server endpoints
- ✅ Very small footprint

**Verdict**: Monitor for specific use cases where it might complement our stack, but currently redundant with Qwik for most scenarios.

### Alpine.js

**Description**: Lightweight JavaScript framework for adding behavior to HTML markup.

**Key Features**:
- Declarative syntax similar to Vue.js
- Small footprint (~7KB)
- No build step required
- Simple reactive and state management

**Compatibility Assessment**:
- ⚠️ Redundant with Qwik for our needs
- ⚠️ Less performant than Qwik's resumability model
- ✅ Has official Astro integration
- ✅ Easy to learn and implement

**Verdict**: Not recommended as it doesn't add sufficient value beyond what Qwik already provides in our stack.

### daisyUI

**Description**: Tailwind CSS component library with simpler class names and theming options.

**Key Features**:
- Simplified class names on top of Tailwind
- Extensive theming capabilities
- Smaller component set than Preline UI
- More customizable approach

**Compatibility Assessment**:
- ⚠️ Would compete with Preline UI recommendation
- ⚠️ Less comprehensive than Preline UI
- ✅ Works with TailwindCSS
- ✅ Better theming system than Preline UI

**Verdict**: Consider only if Preline UI doesn't meet specific theming needs or if a lighter component approach is required.

## Integration Compatibility

The following table shows how these technologies would integrate with our current stack components:

| Technology | Astro | Qwik | TinaCMS | Decap CMS | PostHog |
|------------|-------|------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Astro DB   | ✅    | ✅   | ✅      | ✅        | ✅      |
| Lucia Auth | ✅    | ✅   | ⚠️      | ⚠️        | ✅      |
| Preline UI | ✅    | ✅   | ✅      | ✅        | ✅      |
| HTMX       | ✅    | ⚠️   | ✅      | ✅        | ✅      |
| Alpine.js  | ✅    | ⚠️   | ✅      | ✅        | ✅      |
| daisyUI    | ✅    | ✅   | ✅      | ✅        | ✅      |

## Implementation Considerations

If we decide to incorporate any of these technologies in the future, the following implementation approach is recommended:

1. **Phase 1: Data Layer Enhancement**
   - Implement Astro DB for database functionality
   - Add Lucia Auth for authentication
   - Maintain current CMS strategy

2. **Phase 2: UI Enhancement**
   - Integrate Preline UI for component acceleration
   - Continue Qwik implementation for interactive elements

3. **Phase 3: Evaluation**
   - Assess if HTMX or other technologies fill specific gaps
   - Consider daisyUI if Preline UI limitations are encountered

This phased approach ensures we maintain our performance-first philosophy while strategically enhancing our capabilities.
